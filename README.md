A chill little pomodoro timer that reflects countdowns visually via animations (a rising tide, or disappearing bubbles of light). Users can customize the length of time to work and break for; the timer automatically switches between work and break sessions for you.

Animations sync to the amount of time left on the countdown, serving as a dynamic indicator of countdown progress. Integration into React done using CSS, requestAnimationFrame, and Canvas.

### Interactive Elements
